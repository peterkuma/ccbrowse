<h2>Data Quality</h2>
<p>
    Be aware that this is a beta version. As such, data quality is not
    guaranteed. Especially,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The quality of interpolation is limited.</li>
    <li>Quality Control (QC) information is not shown.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interpolation</h2>
<p>
    Data is interpolated by averaging all data points overlying a given
    pixel of the resulting image. When the scale of the image is greater
    than that of the data, ordinary nearest-neighbor interpolation is performed.
