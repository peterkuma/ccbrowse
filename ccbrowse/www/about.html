<p style="font-size: 1.8rem; color: #555; margin: 0.3rem 0">
ccbrowse is an open source web application for browsing data
from the CALIPSO and CloudSat satellites.
</p>
<h2>About CALIPSO and CloudSat</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov">CALIPSO</a> is a satellite carrying
a lidar and <a href="https://cloudsat.atmos.colostate.edu">CloudSat</a> is a
satellite carrying a cloud radar. Both have been co-located in the satellite
constellation A-Train.
</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>
Select year, month and day in the navigation bar. Select the time of day (UTC)
on the progress bar below the navigation bar. Green/full blue sections of the
bar indicate time periods where data for the selected layer are available.
Striped grey/blue sections of the bar indicate time periods where data are not
available.
</p><p>
Select a layer using the <strong>Layers</strong> dialog in the top right corner.
</p><p>
Use the <strong>+/-</strong> buttons in the top left corner to zoom in and out,
or use the mouse wheel or pinch to zoom on a touchscreen.
</p><p>
Click/touch and drag the image to move time and height. Height in km is
indicated on the left side. The geographical location is indicated at the
bottom. The globe in the top right corner shows the location of the satellite
at the time corresponding to the center of the image.
</p><p>
Double-click on the image to open a dialog showing the numerical value,
date, height, geographical coordinates and the geographical location. Click/tap
on the geographical coordinates to view the location on an external map
(OpenStreetMap).
</p><p>
Loading of the image tiles might take up several seconds due to a delay in data
reading and interpolation.
</p>
<h2>Interpolation</h2>
<p>
Data is interpolated by averaging all data points overlying a given pixel of
the resulting image. When the scale of the image is greater than that of the
data, ordinary nearest-neighbor interpolation is performed.
</p>
