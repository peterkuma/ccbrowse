<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>
For navigation, press and drag the image. Zoom by scrolling. Read off values

<h2>Data Quality</h2>
<p>
Data quality is not guaranteed. Especially,
</p>
<ul>
<li>The quality of interpolation is limited.</li>
<li>Quality Control (QC) information is not shown.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interpolation</h2>
<p>
Data is interpolated by averaging all data points overlying a given pixel of
the resulting image. When the scale of the image is greater than that of the
data, ordinary nearest-neighbor interpolation is performed.
