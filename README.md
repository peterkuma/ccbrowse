# ccbrowse

ccbrowse is an open source web application for browsing data from the CALIPSO
and CloudSat satellites.

It is comprised of a web application and a backend for importing HDF4 (CALIPSO)
and HDF-EOS2 (CloudSat) product files. An example ccbrowse deployment is
available at [browse.ccplot.org](http://browse.ccplot.org).

**Note:** As of version 0.8.0, a new storage driver fileref is the default.
Importing is much faster and takes much less space. You might want to start
with a new repository if migrating from a previous version. Otherwise your
current storage driver as defined in the repository configuration is used.

    - Total Attenuated Backscatter 532 nm
    - Perpendicular Attenuated Backscatter 532 nm
    - Attenuated Backscatter 1064 nm

CloudSat:

## Installation

ccbrowse can be installed on Linux. Other operating systems are currently not
supported. On Debian-based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu and Devuan), install
system dependencies with:

```sh
apt-get install libhdf4-dev libhdfeos-dev libgeos-dev sqlite3 python3 python3-dev python3-setuptools cython3
```

To install ccbrowse:

```sh
pip3 install ccbrowse
```

**Note:** You might have to replace `pip3` with `pip` depending on your Python
distribution.

Make sure that the directory `$HOME/.local/bin` is in the PATH environmental
variable, for example by adding `PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to
`~/.profile`.

## Setup

A new ccbrowse repository `repo` can be created with:

```sh
ccbrowse create repo
cd repo
```

This will create a directory containing a profile specification, a
configuration file, file reference database, tile storage and cache. Next, you
import data to be displayed. Download CALIPSO Level 1B product HDF files from
[NASA Earthdata](https://earthdata.nasa.gov) or CloudSat 2B-GEOPROF product
HDF-EOS2 files from [CloudSat DPC](https://www.cloudsat.cira.colostate.edu).
Choose the primary satellite in `profile.json`:

```json
"primary": "calipso"
```

The choices are `calipso` or `cloudsat`. The primary satellite data need to
be imported first for any given time period for time synchronization to work.
The setting should not be changed after any data have been imported.

To import product files:

```sh
cd repo
ccbrowse import TYPE FILE...
```

where TYPE is `calipso` or `cloudsat` and FILE is a filesystem path to an HDF4
or HDF-EOS2 file. For example:

```sh
ccbrowse import calipso CAL_LID_L1-ValStage1-V3-01.2008-04-30T23-57-40ZN.hdf
```

When the [sqlite](#sqlite-storage) or [filesystem](#filesystem-storage) storage
drivers are used (not the default), it is possible to import only a certain
layer or a zoom level with the `-l` or `-z` options. For example:

```sh
ccbrowse import -l calipso532 -z 2 calipso CAL_LID_L1-ValStage1-V3-01.2008-04-30T23-57-40ZN.hdf
```

This will generate tiles for the layer calipso532 and zoom level 2.

A soft (default) and a hard (option `--hard`) import are possible. The soft
import registers files or tiles by reference. The data are read and
interpolated on demand by the server. The hard import stores interpolated data
in tiles during the import. The hard import is slower during import but faster
during serving, and uses more space.

Finally, run the server with:

```sh
ccbrowse server
```

This will make ccbrowse available in a web browser at
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

If you encounter any issues, [file a bug report](https://github.com/peterkuma/ccbrowse/issues)
or post to the [mailing list](mailto:ccplot-general@lists.sourceforge.net).

## Running the server

By default, the server listens on the port 8080 on localhost for incoming HTTP
connections, but you can change that by supplying an address and port as an
argument. For example:

```sh
ccbrowse server 192.168.0.1:8000
```

To enable debugging mode, use the `-d` switch. Normally, this should be used
with the `auto` type of server backend to see messages on the console. This
will cause the server to respond with detailed messages should an error occur.

```
ccbrowse server -d -s auto
```

Other command line options:

    -c CONFIG   Configuration file (default: config.json)
    -s SERVER   Server backend or "help" for a list of options (default: gunicorn)
    -w WORKERS  Number of server backend workers (default: 10)

## Deployment

For a production deployment, it is recommended to start ccbrowse through
the operating system init system. Below is an example how to create a new
operating system user `ccbrowse`, install ccbrowse in this user's home
directory, and register a new system service to run ccbrowse on system start:

```sh
adduser --system --group --shell /bin/bash ccbrowse
mkdir /var/log/ccbrowse
chown ccbrowse:ccbrowse /var/log/ccbrowse
su - ccbrowse
pip3 install ccbrowse
~/.local/bin/ccbrowse create repo
cd repo
# Edit config.json. Change log to "/var/log/ccbrowse/error.log" and accesslog
# to "/var/log/ccbrowse/access.log".
exit

# For systemd based operating systems (e.g. Ubuntu or Debian):
cp ~ccbrowse/.local/lib/python*/site-packages/ccbrowse/init-scripts/systemd /etc/systemd/system/ccbrowse.service
systemctl enable ccbrowse.service
service ccbrowse start

# For init based operating systems (e.g. Devuan):
cp ~ccbrowse/.local/lib/python*/site-packages/ccbrowse/init-scripts/init /etc/init.d/ccbrowse
update-rc.d ccbrowse defaults
service ccbrowse start
```

To import data:

```sh
su - ccbrowse
cd repo
ccbrowse import ...
exit
service ccbrowse restart
```

In order to make ccbrowse available on a public domain, you can deploy an HTTP
server such as [nginx](http://nginx.org/), and use this example virtual server
configuration:

```
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80 default ipv6only=on;
        server_name your.domain;
        access_log  /var/log/nginx/ccbrowse.access.log;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
}
```

replacing `your.domain` with the desired domain name.

## Repository

The ccbrowse repository is a directory that holds the profile specification,
the configuration, imported file references or tiles and cache. Here is a list
of files in a typical ccbrowse repository:

    cache           Tile cache
    colormaps       Custom colormaps
    layers          Layer data
    config.json     Repository configuration file
    fileref.sqlite  Fileref storage database
    profile.json    Profile specification
    wsgi.py         WSGI module
    README          README file

When you import a product file, it is stored in a storage. Depending on the
configuration, either a reference to the file is saved in the fileref database,
or references to the file are stored in tiles (soft import) in `layers`, or
tile data are stored in tiles in `layers` (hard import). If import is done by
file or tile references, tiles are generated on demand by the server. The raw
data are split and interpolated into tiles of 256Ã—256 px. When tiles are
requested from the server, a chosen colormap is applied on them, and the
resulting images are saved in `cache`.

How tiles and images are stored is configurable. By default references to files
are stored in the fileref database by the fileref storage. A second option is
the SQLite storage, which stores references to the file (soft import) or
interpolated data (hard import) in tiles in a number of SQLite databases,
sharded (split) by the x-coordinate in order to avoid overly large database
files and large number of files in file system directories. A third option is
the filesystem storage, which does the same, but tiles are stored in individual
files. This is suitable for testing purposes, but does not scale well to more
than several product files with typical file systems.

## Configuration

The repository configuration is defined in `config.json`, e.g.:

    "server": "gunicorn",
    "workers": 10,
    "log": null,
    "loglevel": "info",
    "accesslog": null,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8080,
    "debug": false,
    "profile": "profile.json",
    "colormaps": "colormaps",
    "cache": {
        "driver": "htree",
        [...]
    }
    "storage": [
        {
            "driver": "fileref",
            "requires": ["layer", "zoom", "x", "z"],
            [...]
        },
        [...]
    ]

The configuration options are:

    cache                      Server cache (permanent) storage configuration
        driver                 Storage driver name
        [option]...            Storage configuration options
    storage                    List of tile storage definitions
        [storage]              Storage configuration
            requires           List of required parameters

            driver             Storage driver name
            [option]...        Storage configuration options
        [storage]...

The storage configuration options are documented in a later section.

For a list of server backends, use `ccbrowse -s help`.

## Profile specification

The profile specification defines what zoom levels and layers are available
and how to access them. This information is needed by the importers, so that
they know how to cut products into tiles, and by the web application,
so that it knows how to present layers.

A sample `profile.json`:

    {
        "name": "A-Train",
        "primary": "calipso",
        "origin": ["2006-01-01 00:00:00", 0],
        "prefix": "",
        "zoom":
        {
            "0":
            {
                "width": 131072,
                "height": 65536
            },
            [...]
        },
        "layers": {
            "calipso532":
            {
                "format": "png",
                "type": "float32",
                "dimensions": "xz",
                "units": "km<sup>-1</sup> sr<sup>-1</sup>",
                "title": "Total Att. Backscatter 532nm",
                "src": "layers/calipso532/{zoom}/{x},{z}.png",
                "availability": "layers/calipso532/availability.json",
                "attribution": "Data courtesy <a href=\"http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/PRODOCS/calipso/table_calipso.html\">NASA LARC Atmospheric Science Data Center</a>",
                "colormap": "colormaps/calipso-backscatter.json"
            },
            [...]
            "geography":
            {
                "format": "json",
                "type": "geojson",
                "title": "Geography",
                "src": "layers/geography.json"
            },
            [...]
        }
    }

We can see a number of things in this profile specification:

  * It defines a profile called `A-Train`.

  * The primary satellite is `calipso`. This means that CloudSat data will be
    synchronized to CALIPSO.

  * The x-axis begins at midnight 1<sup>st</sup> January 2006, and the z-axis
    begins at an altitude of 0 m.

  * The lowest zoom level (`0`) has tiles of 131072 ms in width and 65536 m in
    height (remember that tiles always have a fixed size of 256Ã—256 px, so this
    determines the zoom factor and aspect ratio).

  * There is a two-dimensional (`xz`) layer called `calipso532`.
    Its full name is "Total Att. Backscatter 532nm" and has units of
    km<sup>-1</sup>.sr<sup>-1</sup>. Data in this layer is rendered with the
    `colormaps/calipso-backscatter.json` colormap.

  * There is a layer called `geography`, which does not have any dimensions
    (it is a single GeoJSON file). This is because it holds information
    about countries and marine areas, which is common for all xâ€“z tiles.

The structure of the profile specification is as follows:

    name                  Name of the profile
    primary               Primary satellite ("calipso" or "cloudsat")
    origin                The physical coordinates of the origin of the system
                          As time in format "year-month-day hour:minute:second"
                          And altitude in meters
    prefix                uRL prefix (when hosting on http://your.domain/prefix/)
    zoom                  List of zoom levels
        0                 Zoom level 0
            width         Tile width in milliseconds
            height        Tile height in meters
        1                 Zoom level 1
        [...]
    layers                List of layers
        [layer name]      Short name of the layer (without white space)
            format        Tile format (png or json)
            type          Tile data type (float32 or geojson)
            dimensions    Layer dimensions
                          "xz" for two-dimensional layers
                          "x" for one-dimensional layers
                          "" for zero-dimensional layers (e.g. geography)
            units         Physical units of data
            title         Layer title
            src           Source URL
            availability  Layer availability
            attribution   Data attribution text displayed on the map
            colormap      Colormap for rendering images
        [...]

As a user, you might wish to modify zoom level and origin, whereas you should
not modify layers unless you developed you own import class, or you are not
interested in importing certain layers (in which case you can remove them).

When modifying the profile specification, the tiles you have already imported
remain unchanged. For example, if you modify zoom levels, the xâ€“z coordinates
would reference the wrong tiles. To avoid the situation, you should either
modify the profile specification *before* you import any products,
or modify the tiles in storage accordingly (which may be difficult).

You can safely change `name`, `primary`, `prefix`, layer `title`, `units`, and
`colormap`.

If you were to add a new layer to the profile specification, it would not
become supported by ccbrowse without an additional effort. The web application
would display its name in the selection of layers, but it could not retrieve
any data. For that, you have write an import class or extend an existing one,
which reads the relevant data from product files and returns an array of data
interpolated on a regular grid of 256Ã—256 elements for each tile. You can find
instructions on how to do that in `src/ccbrowse/products/product.py`, and use
the existing import classes in the same directory as an example.

## Storage

Internally, ccbrowse handles files and tiles as objects. A tile object is a
simple list of parameters (keyâ€“value pairs), e.g.

    {
        "layer": "calipso532",
        "zoom": 2,
        "x": 7120,
        "z": 0,
        "raw_data": [...],
        "format": "png",
        [...]
    }

The parameters include layer, zoom level, coordinates and data, in addition
to all parameters defined in the profile specification under the particular
layer.

Storing and retrieval of objects is done by storage drivers. Which storage
driver to use and its configuration is defined in the configuration file
`config.json`. You can modify the configuration in order to store tiles
in a location other that the default, or use a custom sharding.

The default storage is fileref, which stores file references. If more than
one storage is specified in the configuration file, they are used in a
sequence. For storing, the first storage for which the `store_requires` or
`requires` list is satisfied is selected. For retrieving, the first storage
which satisfies `retrieve_requires` or `requires` and has the tile is used.
`store_requires` and `retrieve_requires` take precedence over `requires`.

There are several storage drivers available.

### Fileref storage

This storage applies to files. It stores references to files in a SQLite
database.

Example configuration:

    {
        "store_requires": ["ref"],
        "retrieve_requires": ["layer", "zoom", "x", "z"],
        "driver": "fileref",
        "src": "fileref.sqlite"
    }

Configuration options:

    driver  "fileref"
    src     Filesystem path of the database file

### Filesystem storage

This storage applies to tiles. This is the simplest type of tile storage, when
objects are stored in standalone files.

Example configuration:

    {
        "driver": "filesystem",
        "requires": ["layer", "zoom", "x", "z", "format"],
        "src": "layers/{layer}/{zoom}/{x},{z}.{format}"
    }

Configuration options:

    driver  "filesystem"
    src     Filesystem path relative to the repository directory

### SQLite storage

This storage applies to tiles. Objects are stored as rows in a SQLite database.

Example configuration:

    {
        "driver": "sqlite",
        "requires": ["layer", "zoom", "x", "z"],
        "src": "layers/{layer}/{zoom}/{x-x%100000}.tiles",
        "select": "SELECT raw_data, modified from tiles WHERE x={x} AND z={z}",
        "insert": "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO tiles (x, z, raw_data, modified) VALUES ({x}, {z}, {raw_data}, strftime('%s'))",
        "init": [
            "CREATE TABLE tiles (x INT, z INT, raw_data BLOB, modified INT)",
            "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tiles_idx ON tiles (x, z)",
            "CREATE INDEX tiles_modified_idx ON tiles (modified)"
        ]
    }

Configuration options:

    driver  "sqlite"
    src     Filesystem path of the database file
    select  SQL query to retrieve object by its coordinates
    insert  SQL query to insert object
    init    List of SQL queries for initialization of an empty database

### HTree storage

This storage applies to tiles and is normally used as tile cache. Objects are
stored in a number of SQLite databases (chunks) according to their hash. Hash
of an object is computed by applying SHA1 function on a key, where key is a
string based on object parameters. The number of database files grows
automatically in order to maintain a given maximum chunk size.

Example configuration:

    {
        "driver": "htree",
        "chunk": "128MB",
        "src": "cache/chunks/{'%02d'%bits}:{hash}.tiles",
        "index": "cache/index.sqlite",
        "lock": "cache/.lock",
        "key": "{layer}/{zoom}/{x},{z};{sha1(colormap)}",
        "hashlen": 5,
        "select": "SELECT raw_data, modified from tiles WHERE layer={layer} AND zoom={zoom} AND x={x} AND z={z} AND colormap={sha1(colormap)}",
        "insert": "INSERT INTO tiles (_id, _hash, layer, zoom, x, z, colormap, modified, raw_data) VALUES ({_id}, {_hash}, {layer}, {zoom}, {x}, {z}, {sha1(colormap)}, strftime('%s'), {raw_data})",
        "init": [
            "CREATE TABLE tiles (_id INT, _hash TEXT, layer TEXT, zoom INT, x INT, z INT, colormap TEXT, modified INT, raw_data BLOB)",
            "CREATE INDEX tiles_id_idx ON tiles (_id)",
            "CREATE INDEX tiles_idx ON tiles (layer, zoom, x, z)"
        ]
    }

Configuration options:

    driver   "htree"
    chunk    Maximum chunk size, after which it is split into two
    src      Filesystem path to chunk
    index    Database holding index of chunks
    lock     Lock file
    key      Object key
    hashlen  Length of sha1 hash of key (more digits are discarded)
    select   SQL query to retrieve object from a chunk
    insert   SQL query to insert object into a chunk
    init     A list of SQL queries to initialize a new chunk

Following the example, when the storage is first created, all objects are being
stored in single database file:

    00:00000.tiles

where "00" before colon is the number of significant bits, and "00000" is the
hash. The number of significant bits is 0, as all objects are stored in the
same chunk.

When the database grows over 128MB, the database is split into two chunks:

    01:00000.tiles
    01:80000.tiles

The first is filled with objects whose first bit of hash is 0 (hash < 80000),
and the second with those whose first bit of hash is 1 (hash >= 80000).

When the second chunk grows 128MB, it is split into two other chunks:

    01:00000.tiles
    02:80000.tiles
    02:c0000.tiles

Now, first two bits of the hash are significant. For example, an object with
hash `720ec` would go to the first database, `9e4b1` to the second and `ee387`
to the third. The number of chunks can increase in this fashion until the last
significant bit of the hash is reached.

The table in chunk is allowed to have an arbitrary name (here "tiles"), but two
columns are required by the HTree storage: `_id` and `_hash`, having the value
of the supplied `_id` and `_hash` parameters (respectively).

## How it works

ccbrowse consists of two parts: a Python backend and a JavaScript web
application. The backend is responsible for importing product files and serving
tiles. The interface between the backend and the web application is defined by
`profile.json`. Data are interpolated onto a regular grid and saved as tiles of
256Ã—256 px. In tile storage, tiles are stored as greyscale PNG images, with
every four adjacent 8-bit pixels coding one 32-bit float value, resulting in
images of 1024Ã—256 px. The web application consists of a Python bottle server
and a JavaScript application running in the browser. The JavaScript application
uses the mapping framework [Leaflet](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/) for
displaying tiles. Information for popups and location is fetched via JSON. The
